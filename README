----BUILD:LINUX----
make

---- BUILD: WINDOWS VS Studio ----
build seperate project for svd_feature and svd_feature_infer
Drag following cpp into project
svd_feature: svd_feature.cpp apex_svd.cpp apex_svd_data.cpp solvers/gbrt/apex_reg_tree.cpp
svd_feature_infer: svd_feature_infer.cpp apex_svd.cpp apex_svd_data.cpp solvers/gbrt/apex_reg_tree.cpp

Then build the project, for cpp in folder tools, drag the single cpp and apex_svd_data.cpp will be sufficient to build the code


----BUILD: MAC----
Due to the lack of pthread implicit semaphore support of some mac system. Current version may not run correctly on MAC.

----FOLDERS----
* solvers: all the customization of SVDFeature solvers, not included in the basic package
* tools  : the auxiliary tools that can be used for experiment
* demo   : the examples that can help to get started on the toolkit
